<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hello! I am **Baowen Zhang**, a Ph.D. Candidate in Sustainable Construction Management at the SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry (SUNY-ESF).

I am an engineer deeply committed to bridging traditional engineering with future sustainability through the power of **Data Science** and algorithms. My core mission is to leverage cutting-edge tools—including **Machine Learning (ML)**, **IFC Digital Twin**, and **Energy Modeling**—to solve truly impactful problems that shape a sustainable future for our planet.

I am driven by the passion to balance **academic rigor** with **industrial applicability**. My research focuses on developing powerful computational methods, from **XGBoost/LSTM** for building energy forecasting to automated **Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)** using digital twin data. I aim to deploy these methods into real-world challenges, accelerating the industrial application of low-carbon materials and improving urban resilience.

I seek to create **"cool" things** that ultimately contribute meaningful impact to the world's environmental efficiency and global goals.

I have published multiple research papers, including works in the **Chemical Engineering Journal** and **Transportation Research Record**.

[Effects of lignin on properties and performances of polyurethane foam from lignin-castor oil synergistic bio-polyols](https://experts.esf.edu/esploro/outputs/journalArticle/Effects-of-lignin-on-properties-and/99978525204826)

Soyeon Jeong, Mairui Zhang, Xianzhi Meng, Yunxuan Wang, Brent Scheidemantle, **Baowen Zhang**, et al.
- Demonstrated that synergistic lignin-castor oil bio-polyols successfully balance the drawbacks of individual components, yielding foams with high compressive strength ($\text{up to } 20\text{ psi}$) and superior thermal insulation ($\text{R}$-value up to $5.69\text{ in}^{-1}$).

[Green co-solvent-assisted one-pot synthesis of high-performance flexible lignin polyurethane foam](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2024.156142)

Mairui Zhang, Soyeon Jeong, Woongbi Cho, Jiae Ryu, **Baowen Zhang**, Paul Crovella, Arthur J. Ragauskas, Jeong Jae Wie, Chang Geun Yoo
- Enhanced the flexibility and mechanical strength of lignin-based polyurethane foam ($\text{LPUF}$) using a green co-solvent and $\text{PEG}-1000$. Achieved a compressive strength up to $226\text{ kPa}$ and competitive thermal insulation ($\text{R}$-value $> 5$), broadening lignin's utility in sustainable materials.

[An Integrated Analytic Hierarchy Process: Markov Model for Rating Condition and Predicting Service Life of Retaining Walls](https://trid.trb.org/view/1996319)

E. Wang, A. Lawal, W. Wu, M. A. Onyango, D. Wu, **B. Zhang**
- Developed an integrated Analytic Hierarchy Process-Markov ($\text{AHP}$-Markov) model for the Tennessee Department of Transportation ($\text{TDOT}$) retaining wall system, providing robust condition rating and service life prediction.
