Hello! I am **Baowen Zhang**, a Ph.D. Candidate in Sustainable Construction Management at the SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry (SUNY-ESF).

I am an engineer deeply committed to bridging traditional engineering with future sustainability through the power of **Data Science** and algorithms. My core mission is to leverage cutting-edge tools—including **Machine Learning (ML)**, **IFC Digital Twin**, and **Energy Modeling**—to solve truly impactful problems that shape a sustainable future for our planet.

I am driven by the passion to balance **academic rigor** with **industrial applicability**. My research focuses on developing powerful computational methods, from **XGBoost/LSTM** for building energy forecasting to automated **Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)** using digital twin data. I aim to deploy these methods into real-world challenges, accelerating the industrial application of low-carbon materials and improving urban resilience.

I seek to create **"cool" things** that ultimately contribute meaningful impact to the world's environmental efficiency.

I have published multiple research papers, including works in the **Chemical Engineering Journal** and **Transportation Research Record**.
