Hello! I am **Baowen Zhang (张宝文)**, a Lecturer in Construction Management at **Colorado State University Pueblo**🐺.

As an educator🧑‍🏫, I bring real-world practice and emerging technologies into the classroom to make learning engaging, applied, and industry-relevant. I use **case-based** and **project-driven** teaching to help students connect core construction principles with modern workflows such as **BIM**, **digital twins**, **energy modeling**, and **data analytics**. My goal is to help students build strong fundamentals while developing the hands-on skills and problem-solving mindset needed for today’s rapidly evolving construction industry.

I am an engineer and researcher🎓 committed to bridging traditional engineering with future sustainability through the power of **Data Science** and algorithms. My mission is to leverage cutting-edge tools—including **Machine Learning (ML)**, **IFC-based Digital Twins**, and **Building Energy Modeling**—to solve impactful real-world problems and support a more sustainable built environment.

I am driven by the passion to balance **academic rigor** with **industry applicability**. My research focuses on developing reliable computational methods, from **XGBoost/LSTM** for building energy forecasting to automated **Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)** enabled by digital twin data. I aim to deploy these methods into real projects and city-scale challenges—accelerating the adoption of low-carbon materials and improving urban resilience and environmental performance.

I enjoy creating **“cool”** technologies and systems that deliver meaningful, measurable impact.

I have published multiple research papers in journals including **Journal of Building Engineering**, **Chemical Engineering Journal**, and **Transportation Research Record**.
